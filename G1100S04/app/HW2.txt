Students should create a model class (freely chosen) with attributes that should map on as many types of controls as possible that must be added onto the activity layout.
Students should get the values from the controls and create an instance of an object.
The types of controls mandatory to be used are:
- ImageView (value from resources, given as a name)
- SeekBar*
- RatingBar*
- ChipGroup with Chip
- CheckBox*
- RadioGroup with RadioButton*
- Switch*
- EditText (at least two, one with data filter)*
- Spinner*
- CaldendarView*
- ProgressBar which should reflect the completeness stage of the form with the controls marked with *
